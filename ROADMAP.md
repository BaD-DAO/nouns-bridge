## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Layer-0 Issues**: Test extensively on testnet first
- **Gas Costs**: Optimize early, monitor closely
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Quick audit + testing
- **Frontend Issues**: Start early, iterate fast

### Operational Risks
- **Tight Timeline**: Cut scope aggressively to MVP
- **Deployment Issues**: Detailed runbooks, dry runs
- **User Adoption**: Clear documentation, support ready

### Contingency Plans
- **Plan B**: If mainnet not ready Day 13, launch Day 15
- **Plan C**: Launch with contracts only, add frontend later
- **Plan D**: Extended testnet phase if critical bugs found

## 📝 Key Assumptions

### What We Assume
- Layer-0 v2 works as documented
- Lil Nouns Governor unchanged
- NDA token already on Base
- Team has full access to all accounts
- RPC infrastructure reliable

### What We Must Have
- ⚠️ NDA token contract address
- ⚠️ Multisig wallet set up
- ⚠️ Layer-0 DVN configured
- ⚠️ RPC URLs (Alchemy/Infura)
- ⚠️ Delegation to MainnetExecutor
