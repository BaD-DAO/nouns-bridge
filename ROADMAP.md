## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Layer-0 Reliability**: Multi-DVN setup, fallback mechanisms
- **Gas Costs**: Optimization, batch operations
- **Cross-chain Delays**: Status tracking, user notifications
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Extensive testing, audits, pause mechanisms

### Operational Risks
- **Delegation Management**: Automated monitoring, alerts
- **Upgrade Coordination**: Timelock, multisig, clear procedures
- **User Adoption**: Documentation, support, gradual rollout

---

## 📝 Notes & Assumptions

### Assumptions
- Layer-0 v2 endpoints available on Base and Mainnet
- Lil Nouns Governor remains unchanged (Compound Bravo fork)
- NDA token already deployed on Base
- DAO multisig available for contract ownership
- Sufficient RPC infrastructure

### Open Questions
- [ ] Exact quorum parameters (mirror Lil Nouns or custom?)
- [ ] Proposal mirroring: automated or manual trigger?
- [ ] Frontend hosting: Vercel, IPFS, or custom?
- [ ] Analytics & monitoring: Dune, The Graph, or custom?
